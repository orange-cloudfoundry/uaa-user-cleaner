### Overview

`go-uaa` is a client library for the [UAA API](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/).

### Usage

```
go get -u github.com/cloudfoundry-community/go-uaa
```

### Experimental

* For the foreseeable future, releases will be in the `v0.x.y` range
* You should expect breaking changes until `v1.x.y` releases occur
* Notifications of breaking changes will be made via release notes associated with each tag
* You should use a vendoring solution (like `dep`) until the `vgo` proposal is fully integrated with the `go` toolchain

### Contributing

Pull requests welcome.
